## About Me

Hello! I am a first-year PhD student in Machine Learning at Georgia Institute of Technology, advised by [Prof. Tuo Zhao](https://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~tzhao80/). Before attending GT, I received my M.S. degree in Statistics from the University of Chicago in 2023, where I am lucky to be advised by [Prof. Claire Donnat](https://donnate.github.io/) and [Prof. Mladen Kolar](https://mkolar.coffeejunkies.org/). Prior to UChicago, I received my bachelorâ€™s degree in Applied Statistics at Yonsei University. At Yonsei, I was advised by [Prof. Sangun Park](https://yonsei.pure.elsevier.com/en/persons/sangun-park).
